Earlier, officials from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and U.S. Federal Aviation Administration surveyed the crash site.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner with 242 people on board bound for Gatwick Airport south of London began losing height seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on Thursday, and erupted in a huge fireball as it hit buildings below.
All but one on board were declared dead in the world's worst aviation disaster in a decade.
Around 30 people died on the ground.
Air India and the Indian government were looking at several aspects of the crash including issues linked to its engine thrust, flaps, and why the landing gear remained open as the plane took off and then came down.

The teenager identified as Aryan shared his experience that left him visibly distressed and struggling to cope with it.

He told reporters he was simply filming the plane on his mobile phone near his rented home, completely unaware that the aircraft would soon transform into a ""ball of fire."" His video, which instantly went viral, gave one of the immediate perspectives of the tragedy.

The plane erupted into flames, sending thick smoke into the sky. As firefighting and rescue teams work on the spot of the crash, a deeper look into the reason behind it will likely be clear from a small box sitting in a corner of the aircraft - the black box.

The plane was headed for London Gatwick Airport when it crashed five minutes after taking off at 1.38pm local time on Thursday.

Video, obtained by local media, showed the aircraft fly over a residential area called Meghani Nagar before crashing, creating what appeared to be a large explosion.

Photographs of the aftermath showed billowing smoke rising over the area and firefighters on charred streets. In another image, people were seen assessing the damage while part of the mangled plane could be seen sticking out of a building.

More than 100 bodies, most of them badly charred, had been brought to the local government hospital for autopsy, authorities said.

Air India’s chair, Natarajan Chandrasekaran, described the incident as a “tragic accident”.

The 242 people onboard the flight to Gatwick airport included 217 adults and 11 children. Of them, 169 were Indian nationals, 53 were Britons, seven Portuguese, and one Canadian, Air India said.

This is the first crash ever of a Boeing 787 aircraft, according to the Aviation Safety Network database.

The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner went down shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad's airport.   
Local media are reporting the aircraft crashed on a Medical College hostel. 
The number of victims on the ground is unclear.
Emergency crews are at the scene in Ahmedabad.
The aircraft reportedly gave a ""mayday"" call, signalling an emergency, shortly after take-off.

Al Jazeera’s Rebecca Bundhun has the latest updates from Mumbai and Milena Veselinovic is monitoring developments at London's Gatwock Airport.

Terry Tozer, an aviation expert in the UK, says while it is too soon to say what caused the crash, “the glaring question in this instance” revolves around the position of the flaps on the Air India flight.
